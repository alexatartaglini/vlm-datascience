# Description: bimodal distribution with quadratic and linear relationships. Bimodal data with two distinct clusters and mixed linear/nonlinear relationships.

# Define the variables in order
variables: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]

# Define the distribution for each variable
variable_objects:
  A: "categorical(probs=[0.6, 0.4], categories=[0, 1])"
  B: "normal(mean=0, std=1, dtype=float)"
  C: "normal(mean=0, std=0.5, dtype=float)"
  D: "uniform(low=-1, high=1, dtype=float)"

# Define dependencies between variables
dependencies:
  A:
    B: "BooleanFunction(['x==0', 'x==1'], [-2, 2], 'mean')"  # Creates two clusters based on A
  B:
    C: "Polynomial([0, 1.5, -0.3])"  # Quadratic relationship between B and C
    D: "Polynomial([0, 0.7])"  # Linear relationship between B and D
  C:
    D: "Polynomial([0, 0.3, 0.2])"  # Another quadratic relationship
