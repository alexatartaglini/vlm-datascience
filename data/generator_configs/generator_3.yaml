# Description: Simpson's Paradox. The overall correlation between variables is different from the correlations within subgroups.
# TODO: fix correlation logic

# Define the variables in order
variables: ["G", "H", "I"]

# Define the distribution of each variable
variable_objects:
  G: "categorical(probs=[0.4, 0.6], categories=[0, 1])"  # Group membership
  H: "normal(mean=0, std=1.1)"
  I: "normal(mean=0, std=1.1)"

# Define dependencies between variables
dependencies:
  G:
    H: "BooleanFunction(['x==0', 'x==1'], [-2, 2], 'mean')"  # Different means for each group
    I: "BooleanFunction(['x==0', 'x==1'], [-1, 3], 'mean')"  # Different means for each group
  H:
    I: "BooleanFunction(['x<0', 'x>=0'], [-0.8, 0.8])"  # Negative correlation within groups, but positive overall
