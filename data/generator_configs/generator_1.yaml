# Description: Heavy-tailed Distribution with Outliers. Natural outliers and different behavior in the tails.

# Define the variables in order
variables: ["X", "Y", "Z"]

# Define the distribution of each variable
variable_objects:
  X: "exponential(rate=0.5)"  # Creates right-skewed distribution
  Y: "normal(mean=0, std=2)"
  Z: "beta(a=2, b=5)"  # Creates asymmetric distribution

# Define dependencies between variables
dependencies:
  X:
    Y: "Polynomial([0, 2, 0.5])"  # Quadratic relationship with increasing spread
  Y:
    Z: "BooleanFunction(['x<-2', 'x>2'], [0.9, 0.1, 0.5])"  # Different behavior for outliers
